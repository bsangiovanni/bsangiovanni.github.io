          <p>Hi! Welcome to my personal webpage üëã I'm Bianca Sangiovanni, and here you can find some information about me. I currently live in Italy, and I have recently obtained my <b>Ph.D. in Robot Control</b> from the University of Pavia (Italy), under the supervision of Professor Antonella Ferrara. As a Ph.D. student, I focused my reserach on the topics of <b>robotics and reinforcement learning</b>. My Ph.D. thesis, titled <i>"Self-configuring Robotic Systems: the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning as a tool for Industrial Manipulators"</i> specifically deals with potential applications of deep learning in the context of decision-making and control for robotic systems. During the course of my doctoral studies, I had the opportunity to work with incredibly brilliant researchers from all around the world and enrich my knowledge in the fields of <b>machine learning, control and identification</b> of complex dynamical models, as well as improve my <b>coding and simulation</b> skills (more details <a href="#skills">here</a>). Furthermore, I had the privilege to mentor students for their Master's projects, hold seminars and lectures for the faculty, and present at national and international conferences. You can check out my complete list of peer-reviewed publications on my <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=5gxYF9kAAAAJ&hl=en"><b>Google Scholar profile</b></a>.</p>

          <p>Previously, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Engineering also from the University of Pavia, with a specialization in Embedded and Control Systems.
         </p>

          <p>In my free time, I enjoy listening to podcasts, watching documentaries, and playing around with game development tools.

          <p>The Thesis aims to present different examples of self-configuring systems involving robotic manipulators. 
            With self-configuring systems, we refer to systems featuring the ability to autonomously adapt their control strategy or general configuration in order to overcome possible limitations encountered during their operation. To this end, the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), a type of machine learning that enables the system to autonomously discover the best strategy to solve a task, is discussed as a tool for decision making or for controlling robotic systems in situations in which a model-based solution is not readily achievable. End-to-End, model-free control approaches are studied and used contextually with - or alternatively to - model-based control and decision strategies. Specifically, the work focuses on industrial manipulators operating in uncertain environments to perform motion and collision avoidance tasks.
            
            For robot motion, a novel switched-structure scheme to achieve both centralized and decentralized control, using the perturbation estimation feature of the Integral Sliding Mode controller, is presented and discussed in detail. Different approaches for decision-making are illustrated.
            
            For collision avoidance, a framework enabling end-to-end, model-free control of robotic manipulators operating in cluttered environments is introduced and tested on several case studies. A novel hybrid algorithm combining DRL-based strategies and conventional planning methods is proposed. The presented approaches are then deployed on different robotic systems, and experimental results are reported.</p></details>

            <p> A novel approach based on DRL, which allows end-to-end, model-free control of a robot operating in a cluttered environment was developed to perform collision avoidance of moving obstacles. After defining the best suitable reinforcement learning framework, which produced promising results in terms of task completion and performance, the effects of the so-called transfer learning applied to different considered scenarios; several robotic settings, operating under different conditions, were reproduced in simulation and used to validate the proposed control approach.
              In addition to the end-to-end strategy, a hybrid dual-mode algorithm that combines conventional motion planning techniques and DRL-based control was introduced. The proposed solution aims to improve the tracking performances of the robot manipulator while allowing model-free control for collision avoidance. A switching metric, which confers self-configuring capabilities to the considered robotic system, is used to define the best possible approach. This allowed to obtain a more reliable motion of the manipulator and deploy the proposed approach to a real system. &nbsp;üé¨ <a href="http://bit.ly/CH11_HYBRID">Video</a></p>

          <p> A novel switched structure control scheme based on Integral Sliding Mode control was designed to allows on-line change between a centralized approach and a decentralized one, in order to control the motion of a robot manipulator. The approach has been tested on different types of manipulators, characterised by different types of uncertainties regarding their dynamical model. The same switched-structure control scheme has then been adapted in order to enable online decision-making with an agent trained with DRL. The proposed approach aims to bypass an a-priori choice of the control scheme for systems operating in uncertain environments, with variable working conditions. </p>
